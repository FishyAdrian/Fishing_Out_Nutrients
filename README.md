# Fishing_Out_Nutrients
Data and code for *Fishing out nutrients: The spatiotemporal and ecological dynamics of fishery-based nutrient extraction* by Gonz√°lez Ortiz et al. 2023

This repository holds the code and data used for the statistical analysis and most figures presented in the manuscript (in progress) *Fishing out nutrients: The spatiotemporal and ecological dynamics of fishery-based nutrient extraction*.

The entirety of our analysis was done in R. Necessary packages for replicating our analysis are outlined at the top of each R script file found here.

Fisheries data was obtained from [Sea Around Us database] (https://www.seaaroundus.org/). We obtained catch data from each EEZ and High Seas region. We only considered catch data from industrial fisheries for this analysis. All artisanal, subsistence, and recreational fisheries were not considered. Bycatch was also not considered in our analysis.

If you would like to replicate our analysis, download this repository and install R, then run the code in the following order:

This will reproduce the entire analysis from start to finish, re-producing the modeled nutrient compositions and the nutrient extraction estimates. Note that new results will differ slightly from those in the paper due to new random values being drawn from the random distributions used to generate the nutrient extraction estimates. However, any new results should be nearly identical.

Please contact Adrian Gonzalez Ortiz (A02366820@usu.edu) for questions regarding the code or modeling.
