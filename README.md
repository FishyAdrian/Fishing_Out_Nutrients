# Fishing_Out_Nutrients
Data and code for *Fishing out nutrients: The spatiotemporal and ecological patterns of fishery-based nutrient extraction* by Gonz√°lez Ortiz et al. 2024

This repository holds the code and data used for the statistical analysis and most figures presented in the manuscript (in review) *Fishing out nutrients: The spatiotemporal and ecological patterns of fishery-based nutrient extraction*.

The entirety of our analysis was done in R. Necessary packages for replicating our analysis are outlined at the top of each R script file found here.

Fisheries data was obtained from the [Sea Around Us database](https://www.seaaroundus.org/) produced by Pauly et al. 2020. We obtained catch data by EEZ and High Seas region. We only considered catch data from industrial fisheries for this analysis. All artisanal, subsistence, and recreational fisheries were not considered. Bycatch was also not considered in our analysis.

Please contact Adrian Gonzalez Ortiz (adgon@umich.edu) for questions regarding the code or modeling.
